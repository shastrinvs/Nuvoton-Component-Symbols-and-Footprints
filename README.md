Nuvoton Component Symbols and Footprints.

Hi.

We have developed these symbols and footprints as per IPC7351 standards for the entire Nuvoton component portfolio.

Currently Diptrace, Eagle and Kicad formats are supported. 

Developers can import to Altium, Cadence, Zuken and others from Eagle format.

Refer to "Readme" file in each component folder before proceeding further.

Each component folder contains the part name, component datasheet, Multi function pin description details to aid the user/developer in the design process

You can access the entire design from below link.
